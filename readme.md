#	Battleship
by: sixsixseven

A two-player Battleship game written entirely in Python.

##	A First Program
Let's see if I can maintain the discipline to finish this game.

##	Your feedback
I value your input, and would love to hear from you. Please feel free to add comments, or make clones to play with the code. This is an exercise in expanding my knowledge, so I'm not currently accepting contributions to the code.

##	To-do:
1.	~~Define classes~~
1.	~~Define functions~~
1.	Develop ship grid/array thing
1.	Define system to place ships on the board without conflicts. Should be random for now.
1.	Scoreboard
1.	How to print the scoreboard
1.	~~How to clear the buffer every turn~~

##	Current class ideas
*	~~Ships~~
*	~~Boards~~
	-	Displays own board
	-	Displays opponent board w/ hits and misses.

##	Current function ideas
*	~~Shooting~~
*	~~Hits~~
*	~~Misses~~
*	Player turnover screen. Clears the console buffer between turns.
*	Turn counter
